# bacnet-csv-logger
* BACnet CSV Logger is an asynchronous Python application designed to run on a Linux and continuously scrape data on an interval from a BACnet system within a building. It compiles this data into daily CSV files.
* In addition to data collection, the app includes functionality to securely transfer these CSV files daily via SCP over a VPN to a SharePoint drive. This ensures centralized and secure data storage.
* The process involves saving a new CSV file every day on the BACnet system. Subsequently, the previous day's data is transferred, undergoing basic checks and processing before synchronization with SharePoint.
